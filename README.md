If you are a tenant who has a deadline to move, because of the court or your housing authority, 
you can use this form to keep track of the apartments you contact, visit, or apply to rent. 
This form can help you show the court or housing authority that you are actively looking for housing.

For example, you may want to use this if:

* You have a deadline to use your Section 8 voucher and want to apply for an extension, or
* A judge ordered you to move, or you agreed to move, and you need more time.

You can come back to this interview more than once to build a record of all of the places you visit
and apply to.
